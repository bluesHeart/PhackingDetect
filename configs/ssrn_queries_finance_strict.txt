# Crossref bibliographic queries for building a *finance-heavy* SSRN corpus (stricter than ssrn_queries_finance.txt).
# One query per line. Lines starting with # are ignored.
#
# Usage:
#   python scripts/build_ssrn_corpus.py --queries-file configs/ssrn_queries_finance_strict.txt --from-year 1990 --until-year 2025 --max-results 400 --download
#
# Rationale:
# - Avoid generic terms like "innovation" that pull many non-finance papers.
# - Prefer finance field labels and canonical topics in JF/JFE/RFS style work.
