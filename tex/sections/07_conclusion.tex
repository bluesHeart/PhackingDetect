\section{Conclusion}

PhackingDetect is an open-source, end-to-end workflow for producing evidence-grounded selective-reporting risk screening reports from a single paper PDF. It is designed to be practical (low-friction to run) while remaining anchored in well-known diagnostics from the p-hacking and selective-reporting literature. The core contribution is not a new statistical test, but an engineering bridge: transforming method-paper concepts into a structured, auditable document-level workflow that points to concrete evidence in tables and figures.

Future work includes more systematic evaluation (Section~5), stronger artifact extraction for complex PDFs, and additional downstream statistical modules (e.g., more formal implementations of p-curve-style inference) when the relevant set of tests can be defined transparently and responsibly.
